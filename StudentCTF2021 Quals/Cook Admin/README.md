# CHALLENGE NAME: Cook Admin

## CATEGORY: OSINT

## DESCRIPTION: 

A website has appeared on the Internet that promises free cookies to everyone.

However, no matter how many times you visit it, you will not see any cookies.

Expose this gang that gives you empty promises.

You will need to find the following people (‘to find’ means to obtain the email address of each of the three persons).

1. **The administrator and owner of the fraudulent website**

2. The courier who published a sample set of cookie pictures

3. The programmer who developed this website (he is a huge fan of birds and his email is on the website domain)

Then I could get the administrator’s email.
